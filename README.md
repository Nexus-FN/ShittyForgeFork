### To do

#### How to use the cheat commands

If you are hosting the server on a vps, then go to admin.h, it should be around line #17 and you should see "IPStr == "127.0.0.1".
Right after this you want to add || "YOURIPHERE". So it would look something like 	
```
if (IPStr == "127.0.0.1" || IPStr == "29.238.102.57" || .....)
```
